# Njord

This is a VS Code dark theme, based on the great Nord Deep, that is based on
nord... I know...
It has a slightly reduced contrast and emphasizes the important parts of your
code (your variables and functions, not the punctuation).

I'll prabably be changing this quite randomly, so don't count on it being
particularly stable...
